## Getting Started  
  
The instruction down below describes the installation of the SingularityNET CLI.
Please check our full [Documentation](https://dev.singularitynet.io/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/CLI/).

### Prerequisites

You should have Python>=3.10 with pip installed.

Additionally, you should make sure that you have the following packages in your system:

* libudev
* libusb 1.0

If you use Ubuntu (or any Linux distribution with APT support) you could run the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

### Install snet-cli using pip

```bash
$ pip3 install snet-cli
```


### Enabling commands autocompletion
If you want to enable the autocompletion of commands, you should install the
* python-argcomplete

On ubuntu (or any Linux distribution with APT support), you could run the following

```bash
sudo apt install python3-argcomplete
```
After the package is installed, activate autocomplete 

##### for all python commands (which includes snet commands as well) 

```bash
sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete3
```
Note: Changes will not take effect until shell is restarted.

##### OR

##### only for snet commands, then you should run the following
```bash
echo 'eval "$(register-python-argcomplete3 snet)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
then
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

Complete documentation is available [here](http://snet-cli-docs.singularitynet.io/)

### Example service call via the CLI
We will use the Sepolia testnet for this example:
```bash
snet network sepolia
```
Create the identity:
```bash
snet identity create example_identity key
```
and enter your private key when asked.  
OR  
you can pass the private key directly:
```bash
snet identity create --private-key "a7638fd785fdb5cf13df0a1d7b5584cc20d4e8526403f0df105eedf23728f538" test key
```
You can also use other identity options. See [documentation](http://snet-cli-docs.singularitynet.io/identity.html).  
You can check your balance using the 
```bash
snet account balance
```
Deposit 70 tokens:
```bash
 snet account deposit 70
```
Press y to confirm.  
You can check your balance again to ensure that the transaction was successfull.  
Before making a call we need to open the payment channel. In this example we will use the organization with id= 26072b8b6a0e448180f8c0e702ab6d2f and group_name= default_group. We will transfer there 70 tokens for 4 weeks:
```bash
 snet channel open-init 26072b8b6a0e448180f8c0e702ab6d2f default_group 70 +4weeks
```
And now we can call the "Exampleservice" service:
```bash
 snet client call 26072b8b6a0e448180f8c0e702ab6d2f Exampleservice default_group add '{"a":10,"b":32}'
```
Press 'Y' to confirm and get service`s response:
>value: 42
